        How it works:
        1. Replace path in 2 redirect URLs (if it gets reflected in) with a mark
           (e.g. /path1 -> /foo/path1 and /path2 -> /foo/path2 will become /foo/[mark] for both)
        2. Compare 2 redirects and generate a regex that matches both
           (e.g. /foo/[mark]?a=1 and /foo/[mark]?a=2 will have the regex: ^/foo/[mark]?a=(.*)$)
        3. Next time if it redirects, replace mark in regex with the path and check if it matches
           (e.g. /path3 -> /foo/path3?a=5, the regex becomes ^/foo/path3?a=(.*)$, which matches)
